## Troubleshooting

### LibreChat Connection Issues
1. Verify LibreChat is running: `curl http://localhost:3080/api/config`
2. Check network connectivity between containers
3. Ensure firewall allows connections on port 3080

### Rate Limiting
If you encounter rate limiting errors:
1. Reduce `RATE_LIMIT_POINTS` in .env
2. Increase `RATE_LIMIT_DURATION` for longer windows
3. Check GGG's current rate limiting policies

### Performance Issues
- Increase container resources if AI responses are slow
- Use faster AI models in LibreChat for quicker responses
- Enable caching for frequently requested data

## API Rate Limits (GGG Compliance)

- **Trade API**: 45 requests per 60 seconds per IP
- **Automatic backoff** on rate limit hits
- **Request queuing** to prevent API abuse
- **Graceful degradation** when APIs are unavailable
